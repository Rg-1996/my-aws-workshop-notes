# AWS Workshop Notes

This repo contains my notes from the **12 Weeks AWS Workshop**.  
Iâ€™m using it to document what I learn and practice while going through the sessions.

## Whatâ€™s Inside
- `[AWS Intro](./aws-intro.md)` â†’ Notes on AWS basics
- `[Setup Notes](./setup-notes.md)` â†’ How I set up Git/GitHub and got this repo running

## Progress

âœ… First notes added

## Notes
This is a work in progress. Iâ€™ll keep updating it as I go through the workshop.
