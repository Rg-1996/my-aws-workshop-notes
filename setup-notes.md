Setup Notes

Before diving into the AWS 12 Weeks Workshop, I spent some time setting up this repo and learning the basics of Git and GitHub. Here’s what I managed to do:

Set up Git with my username and email.

Created SSH keys and connected them to GitHub so I don’t have to type my password every time.

Made this repo on my laptop and linked it with GitHub.

Learned the basic workflow: edit → add → commit → push.

Tried both HTTPS and SSH methods to see the difference.

Found out why notes are usually in .md (Markdown) instead of .txt.

Ran into common Git warnings (like LF vs CRLF) and understood what they mean.

Now I have a working setup where I can write notes, push them to GitHub, and track my progress as I go through the workshop.
